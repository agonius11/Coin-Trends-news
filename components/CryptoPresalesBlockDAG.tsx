            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Coinbase announced a new set of tools through its business
              platform, promising to simplify payments for companies. The
              offerings include payment links and global payments, which will
              allow businesses to use USDC to move funds.

              traditional cross-border payments are associated with slow
              settlements and high costs. Thus, the new tools will provide a
              more transparent structure, and more importantly, they will be
              available through the Coinbase Business platform.

              will enable organizations to send USDC to an email or an on-chain
              address, supporting instantaneous international transfers.
              Moreover, high wire fees and delays are eliminated, as recipients
              will receive their funds without gas fees.On the other hand, the
              payment links function will also allow businesses to collect
              payments through a shareable link. The &quot;bill&quot; will be
              payable instantly via most mainstream crypto wallets.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              While this will eliminate network fees and chargebacks, businesses
              will also not have to worry about credit card processing fees.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The Coinbase platform also supports more sophisticated functions,
              such as content management tools and APIs for automated payments.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The solution is currently in alpha and is available to US
              customers only. Overall, Coinbase&apos;s new strategy could help
              bridge the gap between traditional finance and DeFi, and could
              help popularize the use of crypto in day-to-day business
              transactions.

              While retail investors are considering such strides bullish, the
              wider market is uncertain, which is why presales are trending, as
              traders are cautious about most major coins.

              1. DeepSnitch AI: A token poised for a massive rally
            </h3>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              As BlockDAG presale updates avoid addressing the release date and
              the AI crypto sector grows, DeepSnitch AI is already paving a path
              for 100x after launch.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Because it caters to all types of investors, DeepSnitch AI raised
              over $429K fast, with the community rallying fast behind the
              project due to its powerful utility.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              DeepSnitch AI&apos;s core offering is a complete AI analytics
              suite that uses five AI agents to generate actionable insights.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Because each agent specializes in a different area of the market,
              the centralized AI dashboard will allow users to track whales,
              scan for rug pull risks, catch sentiment shifts, receive alpha
              news, just to name a few.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The AI sector is buzzing already, so DeepSnitch AI could directly
              benefit from the influx of capital into the sector. Yet, regular
              traders looking to up their game may also enter into the AI sector
              by investing in DSNT tokens.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              These strong fundamentals could provide massive momentum to DSNT
              after listing and lead to massive adoption. Because it&apos;s
              priced $0.01915, the token could easily balloon by 100x.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              The 100x projection is a conservative one, but even at that level
              of success, investing $100 could easily turn into $100K.

              2. BlockDAG: What is the BDAG price prediction for Q4?

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              BlockDAG is a project developing a powerful L1 that relies on a
              sophisticated DAG-PoW architecture. The technology will
              supercharge on-chain transactions to up to 15k transactions per
              second.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              BlockDAG also promises to implement bulletproof security that
              could rival Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              However, even though the project is solid, the biggest problem
              with BDAG is missed deadlines. While the original BlockDAG launch
              date was set for August, it unfortunately never materialized.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              There are rumors of a late November launch, but the team never
              confirmed this. As a result, the majority of the community assumes
              that the project will launch once it reaches its $600M target.

              Promising a full L2, LILPEPE uses a zero-trading-tax model to
              simplify transactions while also protecting users from snipers,
              offers a governance perk, and a nifty staking mechanism.

              Although expected long after launch, the project also has plans

              While many traders don&apos;t care about utility per se when it
              comes to memes, some extras will undoubtedly help support the
              project&apos;s future outlook.

              Although its meme-first approach may put off some traders, the
              utility saves LILPEPE and could potentially turn it into a viable
              long-term hold.
